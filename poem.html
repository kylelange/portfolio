      <h2><em><strong>Sentinel</strong></em></h2>
      <p>After the freezing rain<br></br>
      Came the wind<br></br>
      And down hailed the neighbor’s tree<br></br>
      Onto our tree.</p>

      <p>Onto my tree.<br></br>
      The one who stood firm outside my bedroom window and<br></br>
      Sung to me through his leaves<br></br>
      With the wind as inspiration<br></br>
      And a few drinks provided by the storm clouds above<br></br>
      To loosen him up.</p>

      <p>This evening he didn’t make it out of the bar<br></br>
      From under the slick boughs of his boorish neighbor<br></br>
      But he did not flinch from his duty to keep that oaf from<br></br>
      crashing through my bedroom window.</p>

      <p>When my father cut the rest of my bastion<br></br>
      Down to the stump<br></br>
      I went to my room to cry<br></br>
      Into my hands<br></br>
      And gathered myself like a pile of used clothes in my closet<br></br>
      So I could hear and see as little of the affair as possible.</p>

      <p>I recall entire fall months where I would<br></br>
      Climb into my friend on scrap two-by-fours<br></br>
      That I nailed up when I was aged only<br></br>
      In single digits and didn’t stop climbing until<br></br>
      I broke my arm<br></br>
      By attempting to cherry drop<br></br>
      While hanging by a branch from<br></br>
      The backs of my knees when I was twelve.</p>.

      <p>I always considered him my first love.<br></br>
      I knew the taste of his bark<br></br>
      The peck of his leaves<br></br>
      And how his branches held me, sleeping.</p>

      <p>I don’t recall ever feeling a pull towards kissing anyone<br></br>
      In the years while my keeper stood watch.</p>
